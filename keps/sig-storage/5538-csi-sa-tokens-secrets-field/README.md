## Summary

This KEP proposes adding an opt-in mechanism for CSI drivers to receive service account tokens through the dedicated `secrets` field in `NodePublishVolumeRequest` instead of the `volume_context` field. A new field in the `CSIDriver` spec will allow drivers to explicitly opt into using the secrets field for improved security and proper handling of sensitive information. The default behavior will remain unchanged (tokens in volume context) to maintain backward compatibility.

## Motivation

Currently, when the `TokenRequests` field is set in the `CSIDriver` spec, service account tokens are generated by the kubelet and passed to CSI drivers as part of the volume attributes map with the key `csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens`. These tokens could be used for workload identity in cloud providers, particularly in the Secrets Store CSI Driver where they access external secret stores.

However, including sensitive service account tokens in the volume context map alongside non-sensitive information (such as pod name, namespace, service account name) is inappropriate. The volume context is not designed for sensitive data, and this approach has led to security issues:

1. Security vulnerabilities: This approach led to CVE-2023-2878 in the Secrets Store CSI Driver and CVE-2024-3744 in the Azure File CSI Driver where service account tokens were logged as part of GRPC requests.
2. Insufficient protection: The protosanitizer tool used by CSI drivers doesn't consider volume context as "secret", so tokens were logged without sanitization.
3. Driver-specific workarounds: Each driver must implement custom logic to handle token sanitization, creating inconsistency and potential security gaps.

The CSI specification provides a dedicated `secrets` field in `NodePublishVolumeRequest` that is more appropriate for sensitive information like service account tokens.

### Goals

- Add an opt-in mechanism for CSI drivers to receive service account tokens through the secrets field in `NodePublishVolumeRequest`
- Improve security by providing a proper way to handle sensitive token information for drivers that opt-in
- Maintain complete backward compatibility by keeping volume context as the default behavior
- Reduce the need for driver-specific security workarounds for drivers that choose to opt-in

### Non-Goals

- Changing the `TokenRequests` API in `CSIDriver` spec
- Modifying how service account tokens are generated
- Breaking backward compatibility or changing default behavior
- Forcing migration of existing CSI drivers

## Proposal

### User Stories

#### Story 1

As a CSI driver developer, I want the option to configure my driver to receive service account tokens through the proper secrets field so that my driver can handle them securely without requiring custom sanitization logic, while maintaining the choice to use the existing volume context approach if needed.

#### Story 2

As a cluster administrator, I want to ensure that CSI drivers that have opted into secure token handling will not accidentally expose service account tokens in logs or debug output, while not breaking existing drivers that haven't migrated yet.

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats

- CSI drivers must explicitly opt-in to receive tokens via the secrets field
- Default behavior remains unchanged (tokens in volume context) for backward compatibility
- This creates a permanent bifurcation - tokens will never be removed from volume context
- Each CSI driver can choose the approach that works best for their implementation

### Risks and Mitigations

One risk is the permanent maintenance of two token delivery mechanisms. However, this is an acceptable trade-off for maintaining backward compatibility and allowing gradual adoption.

Another potential issue is confusion about which mechanism to use. We'll address this by providing clear documentation and best practice guidance recommending the secrets field for new drivers.

## Design Details

### Current Implementation

Currently, when `TokenRequests` is specified in a `CSIDriver` spec, the kubelet:

1. Generates service account tokens based on the audience and expiration specified in `TokenRequests`
2. Adds the tokens to the volume context map with key `csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens`
3. Passes the volume context to the CSI driver via `NodePublishVolumeRequest.VolumeContext`

### Proposed Implementation

The proposed implementation will add a new field to the `CSIDriver` spec to allow drivers to opt-in to receiving tokens via the secrets field:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: CSIDriver
metadata:
  name: example-csi-driver
spec:
  # ... existing fields ...
  tokenRequests:
    - audience: "example.com"
      expirationSeconds: 3600
  # New field for opting into secrets delivery
  serviceAccountTokenInSecrets: true  # defaults to false
```

The behavior depends on the `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets` field:

- `false` (default): Tokens are placed in `VolumeContext` with key `csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens` (existing behavior)
- `true`: Tokens are placed only in the `Secrets` field with key `csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens` and not in volume context

The `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets` field has the following validation rules:

1. Can only be set when `tokenRequests` is configured. The API server will reject CSIDriver specs that have `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets` set without any `tokenRequests`.
2. Can only be set when the `CSIServiceAccountTokenSecrets` feature gate is enabled. The API server will reject CSIDriver specs that set this field when the feature gate is disabled.

These validations prevent misconfiguration and ensure proper downgrade behavior.

When a CSIDriver is created or updated with `tokenRequests` configured but `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets` is `false` or not specified, the API server will emit a warning (similar to deprecated API warnings) indicating that using volume context for service account tokens is not recommended for security reasons and suggesting the driver opt-in to the secrets field by setting `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets: true`.

The token key in the secrets field will be `csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens`, the same key used in volume context. This makes migration easier for drivers since they only need to change where they read the tokens from, not what key to look for.

### Driver Migration Example

For CSI drivers that want to support both old and new kubelets during migration, here's example fallback code:

```go
const serviceAccountTokenKey = "csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens"

func getServiceAccountTokens(req *csi.NodePublishVolumeRequest) (string, error) {
    // Check secrets field first (new behavior when driver opts in)
    if tokens, ok := req.Secrets[serviceAccountTokenKey]; ok {
        return tokens, nil
    }
    
    // Fall back to volume context (existing behavior)
    if tokens, ok := req.VolumeContext[serviceAccountTokenKey]; ok {
        return tokens, nil
    }
    
    return "", fmt.Errorf("service account tokens not found")
}
```

This approach allows drivers to work with both token delivery mechanisms during the transition period. Once a driver has opted in via `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets: true` and all clusters have been completely upgraded, including nodes, the volume context fallback becomes unnecessary but remains harmless.

### Test Plan

#### Prerequisite testing updates

- Unit tests for kubelet volume manager to verify token placement in secrets field
- Integration tests to ensure CSI drivers receive tokens correctly

#### Unit tests

- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/volume/csi`: `2025-10-03` - `73.6%`
- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/apis/storage/validation`: `2025-10-03` - `96.2%`

New tests will be added for:
- Token placement in secrets field when opt-in is enabled
- Token placement in volume context when opt-in is disabled (default)
- API validation that rejects `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets` being set without `tokenRequests`
- API validation that rejects `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets` being set when feature gate is disabled
- Feature gate behavior (enabled/disabled)

#### e2e tests

- Enhance existing e2e tests to cover both token delivery mechanisms.

### Graduation Criteria

#### Beta

- Feature gate `CSIServiceAccountTokenSecrets` enabled by default
- New `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets` field added to `CSIDriver` spec
- API validation ensures the field can only be set when feature gate is enabled and `tokenRequests` is configured
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, e2e)
- Documentation available

**Rationale for starting at Beta:** Since the feature requires explicit opt-in (`serviceAccountTokenInSecrets` defaults to `false`), enabling the feature gate by default poses no risk to existing deployments.

#### GA

- Feature gate locked to true (always enabled)
- At least one CSI driver updated to use the secrets field
- Clear best practice documentation and migration guides

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

During upgrades, the new field defaults to `false`, so existing CSI drivers continue to work exactly as before. Drivers can opt-in to the new behavior at their own pace.

During downgrades where the feature gate is disabled, the `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets` field must be unset from all CSIDriver specs before the downgrade (API validation enforces this). Once downgraded, all tokens are placed in volume context (existing behavior).

### Version Skew Strategy

The feature will handle version skew gracefully within the supported version skew policy (kube-apiserver at most one minor version newer than kubelet):

**Kubelet and CSI driver skew:**
- Newer kubelet with older CSI driver: Existing behavior preserved (tokens in volume context). Driver continues to work without changes.
- Older kubelet with newer CSI driver spec: CSIDriver field is stored but older kubelet ignores `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets`, places tokens in volume context. Driver must implement fallback (see migration example).
- Same version kubelet and updated CSI driver: Driver can opt-in to secrets field behavior.

**API server and kubelet skew (within n to n-1 minor version skew):**
- Newer kube-apiserver (n) with older kubelet (n-1), feature gate enabled on both: CSIDriver can have `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets` set, but older kubelet may not support it and places tokens in volume context. Drivers must implement fallback.
- Newer kube-apiserver (n) with older kubelet (n-1), feature gate disabled on older kubelet: CSIDriver can have `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets` set (API server allows it), but kubelet ignores it and places tokens in volume context.
- Older kube-apiserver (n-1, feature gate disabled) with newer kubelet (n, feature gate enabled): CSIDriver cannot have `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets` set (rejected by validation), kubelet places tokens in volume context.
- Same version kube-apiserver and kubelet (n), feature gate enabled: Full feature functionality, tokens placed according to `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets` setting.

#### Rollout Sequence

CSI driver authors need to follow a specific rollout sequence when adopting this feature to avoid breaking existing volumes.

**Driver preparation (can happen immediately):**

CSI driver authors can start preparing their drivers right away by adding fallback logic that checks both the secrets field and volume context for tokens (see migration example above). This code change is backward compatible and safe to ship in any driver version, even before any Kubernetes clusters upgrade to 1.35. We encourage driver authors to add this fallback logic as early as possible, cut releases, and even backport to maintenance branches where feasible. This preparatory work is completely independent of cluster upgrades.

**Cluster upgrade and feature enablement:**

Once your driver has the fallback logic deployed, the safe rollout order for enabling the feature in a cluster is:

1. Complete kube-apiserver upgrade to 1.35 (or later version with this feature)
2. Complete kubelet upgrade to 1.35 (or later version with this feature)
3. Ensure CSI driver version with fallback logic is deployed (if not already done in preparation phase)
4. Fully complete CSI driver DaemonSet rollout across all nodes
5. Update CSIDriver manifest to set `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets: true`

There are three important constraints to be aware of:

First, if the CSI driver DaemonSet and CSIDriver object are defined in the same manifest or Helm chart, you need two separate updates with a wait period in between. Deploy the new driver version with fallback logic first, wait for the DaemonSet rollout to complete (all pods updated), then update the same manifest to set `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets: true` in the CSIDriver spec. This two-phase approach is tricky and easy to get wrong.

Second, the CSIDriver field can only be reliably persisted after all kube-apiservers have upgraded to 1.35. If you set it before the upgrade completes, older API servers may drop the field on subsequent writes, requiring reconciliation. Since drivers have fallback logic, this isn't catastrophic but does require re-applying the field.

Third, if you set `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets: true` before all driver pods have updated, new volume mount operations will fail on nodes still running old driver versions. The old driver code only checks volume context, but kubelet will only place tokens in the secrets field once the CSIDriver is updated.

If things go wrong:

- If you update the CSIDriver too early (before driver rollout completes), volume mounts will fail on nodes with old driver pods. You can either roll back the CSIDriver change or accelerate the driver pod rollout.
- If you update the CSIDriver before the API server upgrade completes, the field may be dropped by older API servers. Re-apply the CSIDriver manifest after the upgrade completes.

Note for new drivers: If you're developing a new CSI driver that only supports receiving tokens via the secrets field (without fallback to volume context), you cannot deploy it until both the cluster upgrade to 1.35 is complete and `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets: true` is set. If deployed earlier, the driver won't receive tokens at all and volume mounts will fail. The fallback logic is only needed for existing drivers that want to support mixed cluster versions during upgrade windows.

Driver authors should document this two-phase rollout process clearly in their upgrade guides. Consider providing separate manifests or Helm values to make the two phases explicit for users.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: CSIServiceAccountTokenSecrets
  - Components depending on the feature gate: kubelet, kube-apiserver

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No, enabling the feature gate only adds the ability for CSI drivers to opt-in to receiving tokens via the secrets field. The default behavior (tokens in volume context) remains unchanged for all existing drivers.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes, but the `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets` field must be unset from all CSIDriver specs before disabling the feature gate. API validation prevents the field from being set when the feature gate is disabled. Once the feature gate is disabled, all tokens are placed in volume context (existing behavior).

###### What happens if we re-enable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

CSI drivers can set the `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets` field again in their CSIDriver specs. Once set, those drivers will receive tokens via the secrets field.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

Yes, unit and e2e tests will verify behavior with the feature gate both enabled and disabled, and with the opt-in field set to both true and false.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

The rollback failure risk is minimal since the feature maintains backward compatibility. CSI drivers that haven't opted-in continue to work unchanged. Only drivers that have explicitly opted-in would be affected if the feature is disabled.

Running workloads are not impacted since this only affects new volume mount operations.

###### What specific metrics will inform us that the feature is working as intended?

- `storage_operation_duration_seconds` for volume mount operations should not show increased error rates when the feature is enabled.

### Monitoring Requirements

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

Run `kubectl get CSIDriver` to see whether `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets` is set to `true`.

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working?

- CSI drivers that have opted-in successfully receive tokens through the secrets field
- CSI drivers that haven't opted-in continue to receive tokens via volume context
- Improved security posture for drivers that have migrated to secrets field

### Dependencies

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

No additional services required. The feature only modifies how kubelet communicates with CSI drivers.

### Scalability

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

No new API calls. This only changes the structure of existing CSI driver communication.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

No new API types. This uses existing CSI specification fields.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

No new calls to cloud providers.

### Troubleshooting

###### How does this feature react if the cloud provider is unavailable?

This feature is independent of cloud provider availability. It only affects how kubelet passes tokens to CSI drivers.

###### What are the reasonable SLOs for this feature?

The feature should not add measurable latency to volume mount operations. Token placement should succeed 100% of the time when the feature is enabled.

###### What are the SLIs for this feature?

- Success rate of token placement in secrets field
- Latency impact on volume mount operations (should be negligible)

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

No.

## Implementation History

## Drawbacks

This creates a permanent bifurcation where tokens can be delivered via two different mechanisms, which increases maintenance complexity over time.

There's no guarantee that existing drivers will migrate to the new approach, so we may end up supporting both mechanisms indefinitely.

We'll need to maintain documentation for both approaches, which adds complexity for users trying to understand the correct approach for their use case.

## Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Force migration approach

We could gradually migrate all drivers from volume context to secrets field over multiple releases.

This would eventually remove technical debt and provide a cleaner long-term design, but carries the risk of breaking existing drivers and requires a more complex migration path.

### Alternative 2: Enhance protosanitizer

Instead of providing an opt-in mechanism, we could enhance the protosanitizer library to sanitize specific keys from volume context.

This requires no API changes and is backward compatible, but treats volume context as potentially sensitive and doesn't address the fundamental design issue.

### Alternative 3: New dedicated token field in CSI spec

We could create a new dedicated field specifically for service account tokens in the CSI spec.

This would be very explicit and clear in purpose, but requires CSI spec changes when the secrets field already serves this purpose.

### Alternative 4: Automatic detection and dual placement

We could automatically place tokens in both volume context and secrets field for all drivers.

This needs no driver changes and allows gradual adoption, but always doubles token placement overhead and the security issue remains in volume context.

### Alternative 5: Use CSI capability instead of CSIDriver field

We could add a new CSI capability that kubelet queries to determine whether a driver supports receiving tokens via the secrets field, instead of using a field in the `CSIDriver` API.

This would be cleaner from a CSI specification perspective and avoid permanently adding a field to the Kubernetes `CSIDriver` API for backward compatibility. Drivers could opt-in via CSI capabilities during the GetPluginCapabilities call.

However, service account tokens are not a first-class concept in the CSI specification - they're currently passed as Kubernetes-specific annotations in volume context. Adding a CSI capability for a Kubernetes-specific feature would be mixing concerns. Additionally, this would require changes to the CSI specification itself, which has a separate governance process and would slow down implementation.

## Infrastructure Needed

No additional infrastructure is required. The implementation only requires changes to kubelet and CSI driver implementations.
