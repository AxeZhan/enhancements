# The feature was declared alpha in 1.9 with no KEP. This KEP was only
# about moving it to beta, and then it was later declared GA as part
# of KEP-563 (dual-stack). But we use the beta version as
# latest-milestone here because if we put 1.23 then
# verify-kep-metadata.sh would require us to have a PRR file.
