**Note:** When your KEP is complete, all of these comment blocks should be removed.

To get started with this template:

- [X] **Pick a hosting SIG.**
  Make sure that the problem space is something the SIG is interested in taking
  up. KEPs should not be checked in without a sponsoring SIG.
- [X] **Create an issue in kubernetes/enhancements**
  When filing an enhancement tracking issue, please make sure to complete all
  fields in that template. One of the fields asks for a link to the KEP. You
  can leave that blank until this KEP is filed, and then go back to the
  enhancement and add the link.
- [ ] **Make a copy of this template directory.**
  Copy this template into the owning SIG's directory and name it
  `NNNN-short-descriptive-title`, where `NNNN` is the issue number (with no
  leading-zero padding) assigned to your enhancement above.
- [ ] **Fill out as much of the kep.yaml file as you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Title", "Authors", "Owning-sig",
  "Status", and date-related fields.
- [ ] **Fill out this file as best you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Summary" and "Motivation" sections.
  These should be easy if you've preflighted the idea of the KEP with the
  appropriate SIG(s).
- [ ] **Create a PR for this KEP.**
  Assign it to people in the SIG who are sponsoring this process.
- [ ] **Merge early and iterate.**
  Avoid getting hung up on specific details and instead aim to get the goals of
  the KEP clarified and merged quickly. The best way to do this is to just
  start with the high-level sections and fill out details incrementally in
  subsequent PRs.

Just because a KEP is merged does not mean it is complete or approved. Any KEP
marked as `provisional` is a working document and subject to change. You can
denote sections that are under active debate as follows:

```
<<[UNRESOLVED optional short context or usernames ]>>
Stuff that is being argued.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>
```

When editing KEPS, aim for tightly-scoped, single-topic PRs to keep discussions
focused. If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR
with suggested changes.

One KEP corresponds to one "feature" or "enhancement" for its whole lifecycle.
You do not need a new KEP to move from beta to GA, for example. If
new details emerge that belong in the KEP, edit the KEP. Once a feature has become
"implemented", major changes should get new KEPs.

The canonical place for the latest set of instructions (and the likely source
of this file) is [here](/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md).

**Note:** Any PRs to move a KEP to `implementable`, or significant changes once
it is marked `implementable`, must be approved by each of the KEP approvers.
If none of those approvers are still appropriate, then changes to that list
should be approved by the remaining approvers and/or the owning SIG (or
SIG Architecture for cross-cutting KEPs).

## Summary

This KEP proposes deprecation of `ipvs` in kube-proxy.

## Motivation

At time of writing, kube-proxy has four supported backends (`iptables`, `ipvs`, `nftables`, and `winkernel`).

sig-network currently lacks maintainers who are familar with the `ipvs` backend code, and as such, has been encouraging
users who report `ipvs` bugs to move to using the `nftables` backend mode, where they can. (ie: [first example], [second example])

`ipvs` was introduced in [KEP-265] to solve performance problems in large clusters.
[KEP-3866] was created to introduce a new `nftables` mode to kube-proxy. The goal of this new backend mode
has always been to eventually replace `ipvs` and `iptables`[^1], as it solve the performance issues of iptables
and already solves many of the bugs present in the `ipvs` mode.

[First example]: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/132689#issuecomment-3031585314
[second example]: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/132068#issuecomment-2945169346
[^1]: See https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/3866-nftables-proxy/README.md#we-will-hopefully-be-able-to-trade-2-supported-backends-for-1

[KEP-265]: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/265-ipvs-based-load-balancing/README.md
[KEP-3866]: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/3866-nftables-proxy/README.md

### Goals

- Deprecate the `ipvs` mode of kube-proxy

### Non-Goals

- Removal of the `ipvs` mode of kube-proxy - The specifics of removal of `ipvs` are being handled in [KEP-5343]

[KEP-5343]: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/5344

## Proposal

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

The specifics of removal of `ipvs` mode will be handled in [KEP-5343]

### Risks and Mitigations

N/A

## Design Details

### Test Plan

[X] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

##### Unit tests

N/A - This KEP is only adding a deprecation warning and updating necessary parts of the website

##### Integration tests

N/A - This KEP is only adding a deprecation warning and updating nessesary parts of the website

##### e2e tests

N/A - This KEP is only adding a deprecation warning and updating nessesary parts of the website

### Graduation Criteria

#### Deprecation

- The Kubernetes web site has been updated with deprecation notices for the `ipvs` mode of kube-proxy
- Kube-proxy prints a warning when a user starts kube-proxy in `ipvs` mode
- All nftables-mode bugfixes have been backported to 1.34 and 1.33, to ensure that `ipvs` users on older releases can still migrate to `nftables`.

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

N/A - The only code change is a warning notice

### Version Skew Strategy

N/A - The only code change is a warning notice

## Drawbacks

Users may be running version of the kernel which isn't new enough to support the `nftables` backend mode in kube-proxy.

## Alternatives

Getting active maintainers for `ipvs` may be a short term alternative, see [The ipvs mode of kube-proxy will not save us] (from [KEP-3866]) for details
