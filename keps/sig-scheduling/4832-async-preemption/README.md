**Note:** When your KEP is complete, all of these comment blocks should be removed.

To get started with this template:

- [ ] **Pick a hosting SIG.**
  Make sure that the problem space is something the SIG is interested in taking
  up. KEPs should not be checked in without a sponsoring SIG.
- [ ] **Create an issue in kubernetes/enhancements**
  When filing an enhancement tracking issue, please make sure to complete all
  fields in that template. One of the fields asks for a link to the KEP. You
  can leave that blank until this KEP is filed, and then go back to the
  enhancement and add the link.
- [ ] **Make a copy of this template directory.**
  Copy this template into the owning SIG's directory and name it
  `NNNN-short-descriptive-title`, where `NNNN` is the issue number (with no
  leading-zero padding) assigned to your enhancement above.
- [ ] **Fill out as much of the kep.yaml file as you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Title", "Authors", "Owning-sig",
  "Status", and date-related fields.
- [ ] **Fill out this file as best you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Summary" and "Motivation" sections.
  These should be easy if you've preflighted the idea of the KEP with the
  appropriate SIG(s).
- [ ] **Create a PR for this KEP.**
  Assign it to people in the SIG who are sponsoring this process.
- [ ] **Merge early and iterate.**
  Avoid getting hung up on specific details and instead aim to get the goals of
  the KEP clarified and merged quickly. The best way to do this is to just
  start with the high-level sections and fill out details incrementally in
  subsequent PRs.

Just because a KEP is merged does not mean it is complete or approved. Any KEP
marked as `provisional` is a working document and subject to change. You can
denote sections that are under active debate as follows:

```
<<[UNRESOLVED optional short context or usernames ]>>
Stuff that is being argued.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>
```

When editing KEPS, aim for tightly-scoped, single-topic PRs to keep discussions
focused. If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR
with suggested changes.

One KEP corresponds to one "feature" or "enhancement" for its whole lifecycle.
You do not need a new KEP to move from beta to GA, for example. If
new details emerge that belong in the KEP, edit the KEP. Once a feature has become
"implemented", major changes should get new KEPs.

The canonical place for the latest set of instructions (and the likely source
of this file) is [here](/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md).

**Note:** Any PRs to move a KEP to `implementable`, or significant changes once
it is marked `implementable`, must be approved by each of the KEP approvers.
If none of those approvers are still appropriate, then changes to that list
should be approved by the remaining approvers and/or the owning SIG (or
SIG Architecture for cross-cutting KEPs).

## Summary

<!--
This section is incredibly important for producing high-quality, user-focused
documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap. It should be
possible to collect this information before implementation begins, in order to
avoid requiring implementors to split their attention between writing release
notes and implementing the feature itself. KEP editors and SIG Docs
should help to ensure that the tone and content of the `Summary` section is
useful for a wide audience.

A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.

Both in this section and below, follow the guidelines of the [documentation
style guide]. In particular, wrap lines to a reasonable length, to make it
easier for reviewers to cite specific portions, and to minimize diff churn on
updates.

[documentation style guide]: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/style-guide.md
-->

This KEP proposes decoupling the API calls for the preemption from the scheduling cycle, to enhance the scheduling throughput of the scheduling failure scenarios.

## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals, and non-goals of
this KEP.  Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users. The
motivation section can optionally provide links to [experience reports] to
demonstrate the interest in a KEP within the wider Kubernetes community.

[experience reports]: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/ExperienceReports
-->

The scheduler is basically only one in a cluster,
and hence scheduling throughput is the crutial metric for the scheduler.

The scheduler schedules Pods one by one within the scheduling cycle, 
and we basically try to reduce the API calls as much as possible to enhance the scheduling cycle throughput.

The binding cycle is the example for this motivation; 
1. The scheduling cycle decides where Pod should go to,
2. At the end of the scheduling cycle, the scheduler reserves the Node within the scheduler's cache so that next scheduling cycle will take the current pod into consideration.
3. The scheduling cycle ends and the binding cycle starts; the binding cycle is run asynchronously, and the scheduler starts the next scheduling cycle.

This flow allows us to decouple the API call to assign Pod to the Node from the scheduling cycle so that the API call doesn't block the scheduling throughput.

But, we have the similar problem with the preemption; the preemption is run at PostFilter extension point which is the part of the scheduling cycle.
The preemption has to make some API calls to update Pods' condition and delete Pods after all, which could block the scheduling throughput.

scheduler-perf [actually shows](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/342da505bdefbd849b808cca3cb76c24a993025f/test/integration/scheduler_perf/config/performance-config.yaml#L641) currently the preemption scenario takes too long time, compared to others.

### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of the KEP. What is it trying to achieve? How will we
know that this has succeeded?
-->

- The preemption plugin makes API calls for the preemption asynchronously after `PostFilter` extension point so that the scheduler can continue to other Pods' scheduling while making API calls for preemption.
  - Until the preemption goroutine is done, the Pod won't be rescheduled.

### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this KEP? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->

- Making the same enhancement for DRA is not a goal of this KEP because it's an under-construction feature yet.
  - If DRA maintainers want, technically they can along with this KEP. But, at least in this KEP, we don't discuss how.

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation. What is the desired outcome and how do we measure success?.
The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

### User Stories (Optional)

<!--
Detail the things that people will be able to do if this KEP is implemented.
Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of
the system. The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting
bogged down.
-->

#### Story 1

We have a plugin running the preemption at PostFilter,
but we don't want to make any API calls at PostFilter because it slows down the whole scheduling throughput.

After this KEP is implemented, we determine which Pod(s) to preempt at `PostFilter`,
nominate the Pod based on the calculation,
and actually makes the API calls in the goroutine.

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

<!--
What are the caveats to the proposal?
What are some important details that didn't come across above?
Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
This might be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they relate.
-->

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal, and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
Kubernetes ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed, and by whom?

How will UX be reviewed, and by whom?

Consider including folks who also work outside the SIG or subproject.
-->

#### When kube-apiserver is unstable

When kube-apiserver is unstable and API calls at the preemption goroutine fails frequently,
the scheduler could make a non-best scheduling result 
because the scheduler nominates pods at `PostFilter` though, those Pods won't be scheduled on nodes because the preemption API calls fail.

Let's say many mid-priority Pods are making the preemption API calls.
During the preemption goroutine for them are runnning, the scheduler assumes they'll be scheduled at the Nodes eventually
that the preemptions are targeting via `.Status.NominatedNodeName`.
So, other mid-priority or lower priority Pods' scheduling take those preempter Pods into consideration, 
which is correct if the preemption goroutine finishes successful actually, while which results in non-best scheduling results.
(Higher priority Pods won't be affected; Pods can take place of reserved for lower priority Pods via `.Status.NominatedNodeName`)

But, in the first place though, when kube-apiserver is unstable, the scheduler doesn't behave well 
because it works with a lot of communication with kube-apiserver.
Even if the scheduler makes the best scheduling result, the binding API might fail after all.

So, we don't have to pay a special attention to this issue.

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
-->

To achieve an asynchronous preemption, we will change the preemption plugin's implementation like the following:
1. The preemption PostFilter plugin calculates the preemption target and nominate the Pod for the Node. (We'll use `AddNominatedPod` API exposed from the scheduling framework to plugins.)
2. The preemption PostFilter plugin starts the goroutine to make API calls inside, and return success status (= not wait for the goroutine to finish).
3. The preemption plugin gates the Pod, which the preemption is in-progress, at PreEnqueue extension point so that the target Pod won't be retried during the preemption.

Then, afterwards the preemption goroutine makes actual API calls. 
If the preemption goroutine fails at some point, it reverts the nomination via `AddNominatedPod` with [`clearNominatedNode`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/f5c538418189e119a8dbb60e2a2b22394548e326/pkg/scheduler/schedule_one.go#L135).
If the preemption goroutine succeeds, the Pod is queued back to the queue, and (hopefully) scheduled on the nominated node.

### Consideration to race condition

Thanks to the nomination at `PostFilter`, this new asynchronous preemption shouldn't make any race condition between several scheduling cycles.

Here, I'll discuss what happens in which scenario, and make sure there's no worry.

Let's say pod1 is during the preemption process (node1) at the preemption goroutine, the next scheduling cycle is scheduling pod2. 

#### The pod2's scheduling is successful (pod2 is equal or lower priority than pod1)

As I described above, pod1's `PostFilter` nominates pod1 for node1.

At the scheduling cycle, the scheduler takes such nominated pods that are equal or higher priority than pod1 into consideration;
meaning, pod2 won't rob pod1 of the place on node1.

#### The pod2's scheduling is successful (pod2 is higher priority than pod1)

Even though pod1 is nominated for the node, the scheduler allows pod2 to take node1, where the pod1's preemption made the space. 

Then, when pod1 comes back to the scheduling cycle, it may not be able to land on node1 because pod2 is scheduled there now.
It happens with both the current and this KEP's scheduler, so no issue here.

#### The pod2's scheduling is failed and starts the preemption (pod2 is equal or lower priority than pod1)

The preemption also takes nominated Pods into consideration when calculating the preemption target.

Therefore, if, coincidently, two preemptions for pod1 and pod2 select the same Node after all, 
then the preemption for pod2 should decide to make the space for pod1 and pod2.

So, we don't have to worry about two preemption targeting the same Node make any issue.

#### The pod2's scheduling is failed and starts the preemption (pod2 is higher priority than pod1)

The pod2's preemption ignores pod1's nomination for node1.

If, coincidently, two preemptions for pod1 and pod2 select the same Node after all, 
then the preemption for pod2 may just select the same preemption targets as pod1,
and when pod1 comes back to the scheduling cycle, it (probably) cannot be scheduled on node1 because of pod2.

But, this isn't an issue because the final result is completely the same as the current scheduler;
with the current scheduler, pod1 preempts some Pods on node1, then pod2's scheduling starts, pod2 takes node1, 
and when pod1 comes back to the scheduling cycle, it (probably) cannot be scheduled on node1 because of pod2.

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*
The goal is to ensure that we don't accept enhancements with inadequate testing.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

<!--
Based on reviewers feedback describe what additional tests need to be added prior
implementing this enhancement to ensure the enhancements have also solid foundations.
-->

##### Unit tests

<!--
In principle every added code should have complete unit test coverage, so providing
the exact set of tests will not bring additional value.
However, if complete unit test coverage is not possible, explain the reason of it
together with explanation why this is acceptable.
-->

<!--
Additionally, for Alpha try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:
- <package>: <date> - <current test coverage>
The data can be easily read from:
https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#ci-kubernetes-coverage-unit

This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.
-->

- `/pkg/scheduler/framework/plugins/defaultpreemption/default_preemption.go`: `2024-09-07` - `85.4`
- `/pkg/scheduler/framework/preemption/preemption.go`: `2024-09-07` - `27.2`

##### Integration tests

<!--
Integration tests are contained in k8s.io/kubernetes/test/integration.
Integration tests allow control of the configuration parameters used to start the binaries under test.
This is different from e2e tests which do not allow configuration of parameters.
Doing this allows testing non-default options and multiple different and potentially conflicting command line options.
-->

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html
-->

We have to add integration tests to make sure the asynchronous preemption is performed appropriately, 
especially in the scenarios listed in [Consideration to race condition](#consideration-to-race-condition).

##### e2e tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html

We expect no non-infra related flakes in the last month as a GA graduation criteria.
-->

We'll add test cases that multiple pods are trigger preemption.

### Graduation Criteria

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, [feature gate] graduations, or as
something else. The KEP should keep this high-level with a focus on what
signals will be looked at to determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this enhancement:
- [Maturity levels (`alpha`, `beta`, `stable`)][maturity-levels]
- [Feature gate][feature gate] lifecycle
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc
definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning)
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, GA), regardless of how the
functionality is accessed.

[feature gate]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/feature-gates.md
[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

Below are some examples to consider, in addition to the aforementioned [maturity levels][maturity-levels].

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Initial e2e tests completed and enabled

#### Beta

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Complete features A, B, C
- Additional tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP

#### GA

- N examples of real-world usage
- N installs
- More rigorous forms of testing—e.g., downgrade tests and scalability tests
- Allowing time for feedback

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least two releases between beta and
GA/stable, because there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports,
in back-to-back releases.

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include
[conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md

#### Deprecation

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality that deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag
-->

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- All tests mentioned in [Test Plan](#test-plan) are implemented.

#### Beta

- Gather feedback from users and fix reported bugs.
- Change the feature flag to be enabled by default.

#### GA

- Gather feedback from users and fix reported bugs.

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to maintain previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to make use of the enhancement?
-->

**Upgrade**

During the alpha period, users have to enable the feature gate `SchedulerAsyncPreemption` to opt in this feature.
This is purely internal feature for kube-scheduler, so no other special actions are required outside the scheduler.

**Downgrade**

Users need to disable the feature gate.

### Version Skew Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other
components? What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
enhancement:
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the control plane and nodes?
- How does an n-3 kubelet or kube-proxy without this feature available behave when this feature is used?
- How does an n-1 kube-controller-manager or kube-scheduler without this feature available behave when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the node change? For example, changes to CSI,
  CRI or CNI may require updating that component before the kubelet.
-->

This is purely internal feature for kube-scheduler, and hence no version skew strategy.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

<!--

Production readiness reviews are intended to ensure that features merging into
Kubernetes are observable, scalable and supportable; can be safely operated in
production environments, and can be disabled or rolled back in the event they
cause increased failures in production. See more in the PRR KEP at
https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-architecture/1194-prod-readiness.

The production readiness review questionnaire must be completed and approved
for the KEP to move to `implementable` status and be included in the release.

In some cases, the questions below should also have answers in `kep.yaml`. This
is to enable automation to verify the presence of the review, and to reduce review
burden and latency.

The KEP must have a approver from the
[`prod-readiness-approvers`](http://git.k8s.io/enhancements/OWNERS_ALIASES)
team. Please reach out on the
[#prod-readiness](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CPNHUMN74) channel if
you need any help or guidance.
-->

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting alpha to a release.
-->

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

<!--
Pick one of these and delete the rest.

Documentation is available on [feature gate lifecycle] and expectations, as
well as the [existing list] of feature gates.

[feature gate lifecycle]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/feature-gates.md
[existing list]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/
-->

- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: `SchedulerAsyncPreemption`
  - Components depending on the feature gate:
- [ ] Other
  - Describe the mechanism:
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control
    plane?
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning
    of a node?

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

<!--
Any change of default behavior may be surprising to users or break existing
automations, so be extremely careful here.
-->

No. 
But, like mentioned in [When kube-apiserver is unstable](#when-kube-apiserver-is-unstable), scheduling results could be different.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

<!--
Describe the consequences on existing workloads (e.g., if this is a runtime
feature, can it break the existing applications?).

Feature gates are typically disabled by setting the flag to `false` and
restarting the component. No other changes should be necessary to disable the
feature.

NOTE: Also set `disable-supported` to `true` or `false` in `kep.yaml`.
-->

Yes.
The feature can be disabled in Alpha and Beta versions
by restarting kube-scheduler with the feature-gate off.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

The scheduler again starts to run PostFilter asynchronously.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

<!--
The e2e framework does not currently support enabling or disabling feature
gates. However, unit tests in each component dealing with managing data, created
with and without the feature, are necessary. At the very least, think about
conversion tests if API types are being modified.

Additionally, for features that are introducing a new API field, unit tests that
are exercising the `switch` of feature gate itself (what happens if I disable a
feature gate after having objects written with the new field) are also critical.
You can take a look at one potential example of such test in:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97058/files#diff-7826f7adbc1996a05ab52e3f5f02429e94b68ce6bce0dc534d1be636154fded3R246-R282
-->

Given it's purely internal feature and enablement/disablement requires restarting the component (to change the value of feature flag), 
having feature tests is enough.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

<!--
Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
mid-rollout?

Be sure to consider highly-available clusters, where, for example,
feature flags will be enabled on some API servers and not others during the
rollout. Similarly, consider large clusters and how enablement/disablement
will rollout across nodes.
-->

The partly failure in the rollout isn't there because the scheduler is only the component to rollout this feature. 
But, if upgrading the scheduler itself fails somehow, new Pods won't be scheduled anymore. 
(while Pods, which are already scheduled, won't be affected in any cases.)

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

<!--
What signals should users be paying attention to when the feature is young
that might indicate a serious problem?
-->

Maybe something goes wrong with the preemption if `goroutines_duration_seconds{operation=preemption}` takes too long time.

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

<!--
Describe manual testing that was done and the outcomes.
Longer term, we may want to require automated upgrade/rollback tests, but we
are missing a bunch of machinery and tooling and can't do that now.
-->

No. This feature is an internal feature of the scheduler, 
and just upgrading it and upgrade->downgrade->upgrade are both the same.

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

<!--
Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.
-->

No.

### Monitoring Requirements

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

<!--
Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
logs or events for this purpose.
-->

This feature is used during all Pods' preemption if the feature gate is enabled.
You can find Pods that have experienced the preemption by referring to `.Status.NominatedNodeName`.

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

<!--
For instance, if this is a pod-related feature, it should be possible to determine if the feature is functioning properly
for each individual pod.
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
Please describe all items visible to end users below with sufficient detail so that they can verify correct enablement
and operation of this feature.
Recall that end users cannot usually observe component logs or access metrics.
-->

- [x] API .status
  - Other field: If `.Status.NominatedNodeName` of Pods is non-empty, they have experienced the preemption running asynchronously.

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

<!--
This is your opportunity to define what "normal" quality of service looks like
for a feature.

It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99.9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code

These goals will help you determine what you need to measure (SLIs) in the next
question.
-->

- The failure rate of the preemption goroutine (`goroutines_execution_total{result=error, operation=preemption}`/`goroutines_execution_total{operation=preemption}`) should be < 0.01.

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

<!--
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
-->

- [x] Metrics
  - Metric name: `goroutines_execution_total{result=error, operation=preemption}` 
  - Components exposing the metric: kube-scheduler

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

<!--
Describe the metrics themselves and the reasons why they weren't added (e.g., cost,
implementation difficulties, etc.).
-->

- `goroutines_duration_seconds` (w/ label: `operation`): to observe how many preemption goroutines have failed.
- `goroutines_execution_total` (w/ labels: `operation`, `result`): to observe how long each preemption goroutine takes to complete.

### Dependencies

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

<!--
Think about both cluster-level services (e.g. metrics-server) as well
as node-level agents (e.g. specific version of CRI). Focus on external or
optional services that are needed. For example, if this feature depends on
a cloud provider API, or upon an external software-defined storage or network
control plane.

For each of these, fill in the following—thinking about running existing user workloads
and creating new ones, as well as about cluster-level services (e.g. DNS):
  - [Dependency name]
    - Usage description:
      - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:
-->

No.

### Scalability

<!--
For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them.

For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API call type (e.g. PATCH pods)
  - estimated throughput
  - originating component(s) (e.g. Kubelet, Feature-X-controller)
Focusing mostly on:
  - components listing and/or watching resources they didn't before
  - API calls that may be triggered by changes of some Kubernetes resources
    (e.g. update of object X triggers new updates of object Y)
  - periodic API calls to reconcile state (e.g. periodic fetching state,
    heartbeats, leader election, etc.)
-->

No. Just move the existing API calls from `PostFilter` into goroutines.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type
  - Supported number of objects per cluster
  - Supported number of objects per namespace (for namespace-scoped objects)
-->

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - Which API(s):
  - Estimated increase:
-->

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type(s):
  - Estimated increase in size: (e.g., new annotation of size 32B)
  - Estimated amount of new objects: (e.g., new Object X for every existing Pod)
-->

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

<!--
Look at the [existing SLIs/SLOs].

Think about adding additional work or introducing new steps in between
(e.g. need to do X to start a container), etc. Please describe the details.

[existing SLIs/SLOs]: https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#kubernetes-slisslos
-->

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

<!--
Things to keep in mind include: additional in-memory state, additional
non-trivial computations, excessive access to disks (including increased log
volume), significant amount of data sent and/or received over network, etc.
This through this both in small and large cases, again with respect to the
[supported limits].

[supported limits]: https://git.k8s.io/community//sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md
-->

The scheduler starts to run more goroutines in the preemption plugin, so maybe the CPU usage go up.

###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

<!--
Focus not just on happy cases, but primarily on more pathological cases
(e.g. probes taking a minute instead of milliseconds, failed pods consuming resources, etc.).
If any of the resources can be exhausted, how this is mitigated with the existing limits
(e.g. pods per node) or new limits added by this KEP?

Are there any tests that were run/should be run to understand performance characteristics better
and validate the declared limits?
-->

No.

### Troubleshooting

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.
-->

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

In such cases, API calls for the preemption fails in the preemption goroutines.
But, the scheduler cannot perform not only the preemption, but anything essentially because it cannot get objects, bind Pods to Nodes, etc.

###### What are other known failure modes?

<!--
For each of them, fill in the following information by copying the below template:
  - [Failure mode brief description]
    - Detection: How can it be detected via metrics? Stated another way:
      how can an operator troubleshoot without logging into a master or worker node?
    - Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    - Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
      Not required until feature graduated to beta.
    - Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why.
-->

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

- Sep 07, 2024: The initial KEP is submitted.

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

### Introduce a new extension point

To make this kind of scenario easier to implement for other plugins, we can implement a new extension point `AsyncPostFilter`.
We calculate the preemption target and nominate the Pod for the Node at `PostFilter`, and then `AsyncPostFilter` starts asynchronously, in which the preemption plugin makes API calls for the preemption.

The Pod won't be queued back to the queue until `AsyncPostFilter` is done.

We don't go with this idea because we can implement the async preemption without introducing a new extension point.
Adding a new extension point unnecessarily may result in the regret in the future, and also we can implement it if it's really necessary.

## Infrastructure Needed (Optional)

<!--
Use this section if you need things from the project/SIG. Examples include a
new subproject, repos requested, or GitHub details. Listing these here allows a
SIG to get the process for these resources started right away.
