**Note:** When your KEP is complete, all of these comment blocks should be removed.

To get started with this template:

- [x] **Pick a hosting SIG.**
  Make sure that the problem space is something the SIG is interested in taking
  up. KEPs should not be checked in without a sponsoring SIG.
- [x] **Create an issue in kubernetes/enhancements**
  When filing an enhancement tracking issue, please make sure to complete all
  fields in that template. One of the fields asks for a link to the KEP. You
  can leave that blank until this KEP is filed, and then go back to the
  enhancement and add the link.
- [x] **Make a copy of this template directory.**
  Copy this template into the owning SIG's directory and name it
  `NNNN-short-descriptive-title`, where `NNNN` is the issue number (with no
  leading-zero padding) assigned to your enhancement above.
- [x] **Fill out as much of the kep.yaml file as you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Title", "Authors", "Owning-sig",
  "Status", and date-related fields.
- [ ] **Fill out this file as best you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Summary" and "Motivation" sections.
  These should be easy if you've preflighted the idea of the KEP with the
  appropriate SIG(s).
- [ ] **Create a PR for this KEP.**
  Assign it to people in the SIG who are sponsoring this process.
- [ ] **Merge early and iterate.**
  Avoid getting hung up on specific details and instead aim to get the goals of
  the KEP clarified and merged quickly. The best way to do this is to just
  start with the high-level sections and fill out details incrementally in
  subsequent PRs.

Just because a KEP is merged does not mean it is complete or approved. Any KEP
marked as `provisional` is a working document and subject to change. You can
denote sections that are under active debate as follows:

```
<<[UNRESOLVED optional short context or usernames ]>>
Stuff that is being argued.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>
```

When editing KEPS, aim for tightly-scoped, single-topic PRs to keep discussions
focused. If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR
with suggested changes.

One KEP corresponds to one "feature" or "enhancement" for its whole lifecycle.
You do not need a new KEP to move from beta to GA, for example. If
new details emerge that belong in the KEP, edit the KEP. Once a feature has become
"implemented", major changes should get new KEPs.

The canonical place for the latest set of instructions (and the likely source
of this file) is [here](/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md).

**Note:** Any PRs to move a KEP to `implementable`, or significant changes once
it is marked `implementable`, must be approved by each of the KEP approvers.
If none of those approvers are still appropriate, then changes to that list
should be approved by the remaining approvers and/or the owning SIG (or
SIG Architecture for cross-cutting KEPs).

## Summary

<!--
This section is incredibly important for producing high-quality, user-focused
documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap. It should be
possible to collect this information before implementation begins, in order to
avoid requiring implementors to split their attention between writing release
notes and implementing the feature itself. KEP editors and SIG Docs
should help to ensure that the tone and content of the `Summary` section is
useful for a wide audience.

A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.

Both in this section and below, follow the guidelines of the [documentation
style guide]. In particular, wrap lines to a reasonable length, to make it
easier for reviewers to cite specific portions, and to minimize diff churn on
updates.

[documentation style guide]: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/style-guide.md
-->

This enhancement proposes to let users define human readable printer columns for custom resource definitions using CEL expressions as an alternative to using JSON path.

## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals, and non-goals of
this KEP.  Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users. The
motivation section can optionally provide links to [experience reports] to
demonstrate the interest in a KEP within the wider Kubernetes community.

[experience reports]: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/ExperienceReports
-->

Currently, when creating CustomResourceDefinitions you can define a map of `additionalPrinterColumns` that would be displayed when querying the custom resources with kubectl. This list of `additionalPrinterColumns` are defined using JSON paths. If your CustomResourceDefinition is defined in the following manner, running `kubectl get mycrd myresource` would yield the following response.

```yaml
additionalPrinterColumns:
- name: Desired
  type: integer
  jsonPath: .spec.replicas
- name: Current
  type: integer
  jsonPath: .status.replicas
- name: Age
  type: date
  jsonPath: .metadata.creationTimestamp
```

```
NAME                 DESIRED    CURRENT     AGE
myresource           1          1           7s
```

This approach has a few limitations such as not being able to support arrays, missing support for processing conditionals, not being able to compute column value from multiple fields and difficulty with formatting dates as duration from another timestamp.

With the advent of CEL, we can provide an alternative input for `additionalPrinterColumns` to represent the value in CEL for more complicated table readings. This would be added along with the existing JSON path and users can define `additionalPrinterColumns` for their CRDs in either JSON path or as a CEL expression.

### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of the KEP. What is it trying to achieve? How will we
know that this has succeeded?
-->

- Enable support for defining `additionalPrinterColumns` using CEL expressions in Custom Resource Definitions (CRD).
- Ensure each column uses only one method—either a CEL expression or JSONPath, not both.
- Allow CRDs to define a mix of columns, with some using CEL and others using JSONPath.

### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this KEP? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->

- Modify, replace, or phase out JSONPath-based column definitions.
- Expanding CEL’s access scope beyond the current design constraints (e.g., no access to arbitrary `metadata.*` fields beyond `name` and `generateName`).

  Refer [caveats](#notesconstraintscaveats-optional) section for context.
- Changes to `kubectl` or other clients are required.


## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation. What is the desired outcome and how do we measure success?.
The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

This KEP propses a new, mutually exclusive sibling field to `additionalPrinterColumns[].jsonPath` called `additionalPrinterColumns[].expression`. This field allows defining printer column values using CEL (Common Expression Language) expressions that evaluate to strings.

To support this, the [`CustomResourceColumnDefinition`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/3044a4ce87abae50d8bf9ef77554fa16f2be2f12/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apis/apiextensions/types.go#L237-L257) struct will be extended to accept CEL expressions for printer columns, and the API server will evaluate these expressions dynamically when responding to `Table` requests (e.g., `kubectl get`), producing richer, computed, or combined column outputs.

### Example

Given this CRD snippet:

```yaml
additionalPrinterColumns:
- name: Replicas
  type: string
  expression: "%d/%d".format([self.status.replicas, self.spec.replicas])
- name: Age
  type: date
  jsonPath: .metadata.creationTimestamp
- name: Status
  type: string
  expression: self.status.replicas == self.spec.replicas ? "READY" : "WAITING"
```

The `kubectl get` output might look like:

```
NAME                 REPLICAS     AGE      STATUS
myresource           1/1          7s       READY
myresource2          0/1          2s       WAITING
```

This enhancement enables flexible, human-friendly column formatting and logic in `kubectl get` outputs without requiring external tooling or complex `JSONPath` workarounds.

### User Stories (Optional)

<!--
Detail the things that people will be able to do if this KEP is implemented.
Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of
the system. The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting
bogged down.
-->

#### Story 1

As a Kubernetes user, I want to define `additionalPrinterColumns` that correctly aggregate and display all nested arrays within my CRD, so that `kubectl get` outputs the full list of hosts instead of only showing the first array. Current JSONPath-based columns only print the first matching array, resulting in incomplete data.

Using CEL expressions for `additionalPrinterColumns` allows combining all nested arrays into a single flattened list, providing complete and accurate output in `kubectl get`.

```yaml
additionalPrinterColumns:
- name: hosts
  jsonPath: .spec.servers[*].hosts
  type: string
- name: hosts
  type: string
  description: "All hosts from all servers"
  expression: "self.spec.servers.map(s, s.hosts)"
```

Output:
```
NAME   HOSTS                                   HOSTS CEL
foo0   ["foo.example.com","bar.example.com"]   [[foo.example.com, bar.example.com], [baz.example.com]]
```

In the above example:

* `spec.servers` is mapped to extract each `hosts` array.
* The resulting list of all hosts is displayed in the column output.

Once we support the CEL `flatten()` macro in the Kubernetes CEL environment, we can get the exact output with `(self.spec.servers.map(s, s.hosts)).flatten()`.

* https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-sig-api-machinery/c/GxXWe6T8DoM

#### Story 2

As a Kubernetes user, I want to display the status of a specific condition (e.g., the "Ready" condition) from a list of status conditions in a human-readable column when using `kubectl get`. Currently, `jsonPath` based additionalPrinterColumns cannot directly extract and display a single condition's status from an array of conditions, which limits usability and clarity.

With CEL based additionalPrinterColumns, I can define a column using an expression that filters and selects the relevant condition, making the output more meaningful.

**Example:**

Using the following CRD snippet, I define a `READY` column that uses a CEL expression to extract the status of the "Ready" condition:

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
...
spec:
  ...
  versions:
    ...
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          status:
            type: object
            properties:
              conditions:
                type: array
                items:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    type:
                      type: string
                    status:
                      type: string
  ...
  additionalPrinterColumns:
    - name: READY
      type: string
      description: 'Status of the Ready condition'
      expression: 'self.status.conditions.exists(c, c.type == "Ready") ? self.status.conditions.filter(c, c.type == "Ready")[0].status : "Unknown"'
```

Output:
```
NAME                READY
example-resource    True
example-resource2   Unknown
```

This expression checks if a condition with `type == "Ready"` exists. If so, it returns its status; otherwise, it returns `"Unknown"`. This approach enables clear, user-friendly status reporting for conditions stored as arrays in the CRD.

**References:**

* https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67268


#### Story 3

As a Kubernetes user, I want to define an additional printer column that combines multiple fields from a sub-resource into a single human-readable string. The additionalPrinterColumns defined using `jsonPath` can’t concatenate fields, so the output is either limited or unclear.

With CEL expressions in additionalPrinterColumns, it is possible to format and combine multiple fields cleanly for better readability.

For example, in a CRD with `.spec.sub.foo` and `.spec.sub.bar`, this column defined using CEL expression combines the two fields with a slash:

```yaml
additionalPrinterColumns:
- name: "Combined"
  type: string
  description: "Combined Foo and Bar values"
  expression: 'format("%s/%s", self.spec.sub.foo, self.spec.sub.bar)'
```

Output:
```
NAME          COMBINED     AGE
myresource    foo/bar      7s
```

This shows output like `val1/val2` in `kubectl get` columns, improving clarity.

**References:**

* https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues/3872

#### Story 4

As a Kubernetes user, I want to format dates as relative durations (e.g., "5m ago" instead of absolute timestamps) in printer columns, making it easier to understand resource age or timing at a glance.

**Example:**

```yaml
additionalPrinterColumns:
  - name: Duration
    type: string
    description: Duration between start and completion
    expression: 'timestamp(self.status.completionTimestamp) - timestamp(self.status.startTimestamp)'
```

Output:
```
NAME         DURATION
sample-job   24h7m10s
```

This would allow `kubectl get` to display the elapsed time between start and completion timestamps as a formatted duration.

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

<!--
What are the caveats to the proposal?
What are some important details that didn't come across above?
Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
This might be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they relate.
-->

As of this writing, when defining `additionalPrinterColumns` using **CEL expressions**, access to fields under `metadata` is **limited**.
Only `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are accessible, as per the current [design decision](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/55f2bc10435160619d1ece8de49a1c0f8fcdf276/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apiserver/schema/cel/model/schemas.go#L39-L73).

This makes CEL-based columns less flexible than those defined using JSONPath, because columns definied using JSONPath can access additional `metadata` fields like `creationTimestamp`, `labels`, and `ownerReferences`, etc.

For example, the following `jsonPath`-based columns defined in the [Cluster API project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/ef10e5aea3d3c9525dd83fa8a15005fc0b97d1b9/test/infrastructure/docker/config/crd/bases/infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io_devmachines.yaml#L19-L39)) are valid:

```yaml
additionalPrinterColumns:
- name: Age
  type: date
  description: Time since creation
  jsonPath: .metadata.creationTimestamp
- name: Cluster
  type: string
  description: Associated Cluster
  jsonPath: .metadata.labels['cluster\.x-k8s\.io/cluster-name']
- name: Machine
  type: string
  description: Owning Machine
  jsonPath: .metadata.ownerReferences[?(@.kind=="Machine")].name
```

But when attempting to define the same columns using CEL expressions, it fails because any field under `metadata` (except `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName`) is dropped during the [conversion of the CRD structural schema to a CEL declaration](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/71f0fc6e72d53d5caf50b1314ca4d754463117f0/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apiserver/schema/cel/model/schemas.go#L26-L75):

```yaml
additionalPrinterColumns:
- name: Age
  type: date
  description: Time since creation
  expression: self.metadata.creationTimestamp
```

Error:

```
The CustomResourceDefinition "jobs.example.com" is invalid: spec.additionalPrinterColumns[1]: Internal error: CEL compilation failed for self.metadata.creationTimestamp rules: compilation failed: ERROR: <input>:1:14: undefined field 'creationTimestamp'
 | self.metadata.creationTimestamp
 | .............^
```

There's a similar ongoing discussion here – [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/122163](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/122163)

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal, and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
Kubernetes ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed, and by whom?

How will UX be reviewed, and by whom?

Consider including folks who also work outside the SIG or subproject.
-->

#### Complex CEL expressions may impact compilation performance

With CEL-based `additionalPrinterColumns`, users may write highly complex expressions to fulfill specific use cases. These expressions can lead to longer compilation times or excessive compute cost during CRD creation.

**Mitigation:**

A finite CEL cost model is enforced, as is standard with other CEL-enabled features in Kubernetes. This model limits the computational cost during expression compilation. If a CEL expression exceeds the allowed cost, the compilation will timeout and fail gracefully.

For expressions that are within the cost limits but still slow due to complexity, the responsibility lies with the CRD author to keep or drop them.


#### Runtime evaluation errors despite successful compilation

CEL expressions are compiled during CRD creation but evaluated later during API usage, such as `kubectl get <resource>`. As a result, runtime data inconsistencies can cause evaluation errors even if compilation was successful.

For example, if a CEL expression references fields not present in a given Custom Resource instance—due to missing data, schema changes, or optional fields—the evaluation may fail.

**Mitigation:**

This behavior is aligned with how `jsonPath` based `additionalPrinterColumns` currently function. If a `jsonPath` evaluation fails, an empty value is printed in the column.

The same strategy will be applied for CEL: evaluation failures will result in an empty column, and the underlying error will be logged. This ensures user experience remains consistent and resilient to partial data issues.

Example:

```yaml
openAPIV3Schema:
  status:
    type: object
    properties:
      startTimestamp:
      type: string
      format: date-time # Incorrect format
    completionTimestamp:
      type: string
      format: date-time # Incorrect format
    duration:
      type: string
additionalPrinterColumns:
- name: Duration
  type: string
  description: Duration between start and completion
  expression: 'timestamp(self.status.completionTimestamp) - timestamp(self.status.startTimestamp)'
```

In the above example, the format for the fields are incorrect, but the CEL expression is valid. This results in the CEL program returning an error during evaluation at the runtime. This happens because the format we've defined, `date-time` is incorrect. The correct format defined in [supportedFormats](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/4468565250c940bbf70c2bad07f2aad387454be1/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apiserver/validation/formats.go#L26-L51) is `datetime`. The above would example would give us the following error:

```
NAME         DURATION
sample-job   no such overload: timestamp(string)
```


## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
-->

Today CRD additionalPrinterColumns only supports JSONPath. This is done today with [TableConvertor](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/8a0f6370e4b53b648050c534f0ee11b776f900a6/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/registry/customresource/tableconvertor/tableconvertor.go) that converts objects to `metav1.Table`. Once we create a CRD, a new TableConvertor object will be created along with it. The TableConvertor is what processes the output for additionalPrinterColumns when we query for custom resources. The JSONPath is validated during the [CRD validation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dae746b59d390c304cc2019d8840f99872a5723a/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apis/apiextensions/validation/validation.go#L807-L811) and is [parsed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/8a0f6370e4b53b648050c534f0ee11b776f900a6/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/registry/customresource/tableconvertor/tableconvertor.go#L50-L53) when the TableConvertor is created. We propose extending the CRD API as well as the `TableConvertor` logic to handle CEL expressions alongside the existing JSONPath logic without changing any of the current behaviour.

### API Changes

We extend the `CustomResourceColumnDefinition` type by adding an `Expression` field which takes CEL expressions as a string.

```diff
type CustomResourceColumnDefinition struct {
  ...
  JSONPath   string

+ Expression string
}
```

```diff
type CustomResourceColumnDefinition struct {
  // ...
  JSONPath string `json:"jsonPath,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,6,opt,name=jsonPath"`
	
+ Expression string `json:"expression,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,7,opt,name=expression"`
}
```

### Proposed flow of CEL additionalPrinterColumns

This CEL expression would then be compiled twice:
- During the [CRD validation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/b35c5c0a301d326fdfa353943fca077778544ac6/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apis/apiextensions/validation/validation.go#L789-L790) and, 
- Then again during the [TableConvertor creation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/b35c5c0a301d326fdfa353943fca077778544ac6/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/registry/customresource/tableconvertor/tableconvertor.go#L39-L41)

The compiled CEL program would then be later evaluated at runtime when [printing columns during resource listing](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/b35c5c0a301d326fdfa353943fca077778544ac6/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/registry/customresource/tableconvertor/tableconvertor.go#L115-L135).

### CEL Compilation

To handle the CEL compilation, we add a new `CompileColumn()` function to the `apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apiserver/schema/cel` package which would be called during both CRD Validation and from inside the `TableConvertor.New()` function.

```go
func CompileColumn(expr string, s *schema.Structural, declType *apiservercel.DeclType, perCallLimit uint64, baseEnvSet *environment.EnvSet, envLoader EnvLoader) ColumnCompilationResult {
  ...
}
```

### Validation

We expect the additionalPrinterColumns of a CustomResourceDefinition to either have a `jsonPath` or an `expression` field. Currently additionalPrinterColumns are validated from the `ValidateCustomResourceColumnDefinition` function. Once we add the new expression field, we compile the CEL expression here using the `cel.CompileColumn()` function. If the CEL compilation fails at validation, the CRD is not applied.

```diff
func ValidateCustomResourceColumnDefinition(col *apiextensions.CustomResourceColumnDefinition, fldPath *field.Path) field.ErrorList {
  // ...
  if len(col.JSONPath) == 0 && len(col.expression) == 0 {
    allErrs = append(allErrs, field.Required(fldPath.Child("JSONPath or expression"), "either JSONPath or CEL expression must be specified"))
  }

  if len(col.JSONPath) != 0 {
    if errs := validateSimpleJSONPath(col.JSONPath, fldPath.Child("jsonPath")); len(errs) > 0 {
      allErrs = append(allErrs, errs...)
    }
  }

+ if len(col.expression) != 0 {
+   // Handle CEL context creation and error handling
+   var celContext *CELSchemaContext
+   celContext = PrinterColumnCELContext(schema)
+   ...

    // CEL compilation during the validation stage
    compilationResult = cel.CompileColumn(col.Expression, structuralSchema, model.SchemaDeclType(s, true), celconfig.PerCallLimit, environment.MustBaseEnvSet(environment.DefaultCompatibilityVersion(), true), cel.StoredExpressionsEnvLoader())
    // Based on the CEL compilation result validate the additionalPrinterColumn
    if compilationResult.Error != nil {
      allErrs = append(allErrs, field.InternalError(fldPath, fmt.Errorf("CEL compilation failed for %s rules: %s", col.Expression, compilationResult.Error)))
    }

    ...
  }

  return allErrs
}
```

### Implementation

Inside [tableconvertor.go](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/8a0f6370e4b53b648050c534f0ee11b776f900a6/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/registry/customresource/tableconvertor/tableconvertor.go):

- We have the [TableConvertor.New()](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dae746b59d390c304cc2019d8840f99872a5723a/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/registry/customresource/tableconvertor/tableconvertor.go#L41) function which creates the TableConvertor object for a CRD. This is done from the [crdHandler](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dae746b59d390c304cc2019d8840f99872a5723a/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apiserver/customresource_handler.go#L810) when the CRD is created or updated.

- Each column under additionalPrinterColumns is defined in the TableConvertor object with a [columnPrinter interface](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dae746b59d390c304cc2019d8840f99872a5723a/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/registry/customresource/tableconvertor/tableconvertor.go#L74-L77). This interface has two methods, `FindResults()` and `PrintResults()`, which would be used by the TableConvertor object to compute and print the additionalPrinterColumns' values when we do a GET operation on the CRD.

Today for JSONPath additionalPrinterColumns, we parse the JSONPath expression inside the `TableConvertor.New()` function [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dae746b59d390c304cc2019d8840f99872a5723a/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/registry/customresource/tableconvertor/tableconvertor.go#L49-L69) like so:

```go
func New(crdColumns []apiextensionsv1.CustomResourceColumnDefinition) (rest.TableConvertor, error) {
  ...
  path := jsonpath.New(col.Name)
  if err := path.Parse(fmt.Sprintf("{%s}", col.JSONPath)); err != nil {
    return c, fmt.Errorf("unrecognized column definition %q", col.JSONPath)
  }
  path.AllowMissingKeys(true)
  c.additionalColumns = append(c.additionalColumns, path)
}
```

We then call this function in `TableConvertor.New()` to allow handling additionalPrinterColumns defined using CEL expressions:

```diff
+ func New(crdColumns []apiextensionsv1.CustomResourceColumnDefinition, s *schema.Structural) (rest.TableConvertor, error) {
  ...
+   if len(col.JSONPath) > 0 && len(col.Expression) == 0 {
      // existing jsonPath logic
+   } else if len(col.Expression) > 0 && len(col.JSONPath) == 0 {
+     compResult := CompileColumn(col.Expression, s, model.SchemaDeclType(s, true), celconfig.PerCallLimit, environment.MustBaseEnvSet(environment.DefaultCompatibilityVersion(), true), cel.StoredExpressionsEnvLoader())

+     if compResult.Error != nil {
+       return c, fmt.Errorf("CEL compilation error %q", compResult.Error)
+      }
+     c.additionalColumns = append(c.additionalColumns, compResult)
+   }
}
```

To make all this work, we also introduce the following:

- A new struct `ColumnCompilationResult`:

```go
type ColumnCompilationResult struct {
  Error          error
  MaxCost        uint64
  MaxCardinality uint64
  FieldPath      *field.Path
  Program        cel.Program
}
```

- This struct implements the [columnPrinter](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/8a0f6370e4b53b648050c534f0ee11b776f900a6/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/registry/customresource/tableconvertor/tableconvertor.go#L74-L77) interface:

```go
func (c ColumnCompilationResult) FindResults(data interface{}) ([][]reflect.Value, error) {
  ...
}

func (c ColumnCompilationResult) PrintResults(w io.Writer, results []reflect.Value) error {
  ...
}
```

- The output of `cel.CompileColumn()` returns a `ColumnCompilationResult` object for each additionalPrinterColumn. 

With all of this we can pass the CEL program to the TableConvertor's `ConvertToTable()` method, which will call `FindResults` and `PrintResults` for all additionalPrinterColumns, regardless of whether they're defined with JSONPath or CEL expressions.


### CEL vs JSONPath Performance Analysis

A big part of the discussions for our proposal was the CEL cost limits since this is the first time CEL is added to the read path. As part of this we've done some benchmarking of the time it takes to parse and compile equivalent JSONPath and CEL expressions.

For the performance analysis, we introduced two new benchmark tests to the `tableconvertor_test.go` file – `Benchmark_CEL` and `Benchmark_JSONPath`.

Please find the raw output of the benchmark tests, as well as the code for executing them in the following gist:
[https://gist.github.com/sreeram-venkitesh/f4aff1ae7957a5a3b9c6c53e869b7403](https://gist.github.com/sreeram-venkitesh/f4aff1ae7957a5a3b9c6c53e869b7403)


Considering the following 10 iterations of the `Benchmark_CEL` and `Benchmark_JSONPath` tests:

```
  CEL Benchmark Results (10 runs):
  - Run 1: 2,772 iterations, 461,257 ns/op
  - Run 2: 3,070 iterations, 355,537 ns/op
  - Run 3: 3,247 iterations, 353,626 ns/op
  - Run 4: 3,090 iterations, 360,392 ns/op
  - Run 5: 3,249 iterations, 351,305 ns/op
  - Run 6: 2,942 iterations, 454,657 ns/op
  - Run 7: 3,379 iterations, 354,431 ns/op
  - Run 8: 2,858 iterations, 365,886 ns/op
  - Run 9: 3,374 iterations, 353,106 ns/op
  - Run 10: 3,130 iterations, 368,940 ns/op

  JSONPath Benchmark Results (10 runs):
  - Run 1: 76,616 iterations, 19,376 ns/op
  - Run 2: 73,274 iterations, 15,761 ns/op
  - Run 3: 72,625 iterations, 18,572 ns/op
  - Run 4: 70,324 iterations, 15,896 ns/op
  - Run 5: 69,409 iterations, 15,892 ns/op
  - Run 6: 70,672 iterations, 17,888 ns/op
  - Run 7: 72,145 iterations, 16,176 ns/op
  - Run 8: 69,602 iterations, 16,203 ns/op
  - Run 9: 68,079 iterations, 24,558 ns/op
  - Run 10: 62,689 iterations, 16,214 ns/op
```

The following table provides an average performance analysis across CEL and JSONPath based additionalPrinterColumns:


|                                      | CEL (Benchmark_CEL)                                                                                                   | JSONPath (Benchmark_JSONPath)                                                                                   |

_**Conclusion**_ — Across the 10 runs of the benchmark tests, on average, CEL is 20x slower than JSONPath (383µs vs 18µs).

When running the benchmark tests individually, we observed that CEL was consistently ~20-50x slower than JSONPath. 

Based on these current findings, the end users should not find a noticeable difference in the performance when working with CEL for additionalPrinterColumns.

<!--

Hence, the end users might start seeing a non-negligible increase in the total time and CPU usage for apiserver when they are working with a large number of Custom Resources.

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*
The goal is to ensure that we don't accept enhancements with inadequate testing.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

<!--
Based on reviewers feedback describe what additional tests need to be added prior
implementing this enhancement to ensure the enhancements have also solid foundations.
-->

##### Unit tests

<!--
In principle every added code should have complete unit test coverage, so providing
the exact set of tests will not bring additional value.
However, if complete unit test coverage is not possible, explain the reason of it
together with explanation why this is acceptable.
-->

<!--
Additionally, for Alpha try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:
- <package>: <date> - <current test coverage>
The data can be easily read from:
https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#ci-kubernetes-coverage-unit

This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.

##### Integration tests

<!--
Integration tests are contained in k8s.io/kubernetes/test/integration.
Integration tests allow control of the configuration parameters used to start the binaries under test.
This is different from e2e tests which do not allow configuration of parameters.
Doing this allows testing non-default options and multiple different and potentially conflicting command line options.

We expect no non-infra related flakes in the last month as a GA graduation criteria.
-->

<!-- - <test>: <link to test coverage> -->
We will test all cases in integration test and unit test. If needed, we can add e2e tests before beta graduation. We are planning to extend the existing [e2e tests for CRDs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/3df3b83226530bda69ffcb7b4450026139b2cd11/test/e2e/apimachinery/custom_resource_definition.go).

### Graduation Criteria

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, [feature gate] graduations, or as
something else. The KEP should keep this high-level with a focus on what
signals will be looked at to determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this enhancement:
- [Maturity levels (`alpha`, `beta`, `stable`)][maturity-levels]
- [Feature gate][feature gate] lifecycle
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc
definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning)
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, GA), regardless of how the
functionality is accessed.

[feature gate]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/feature-gates.md
[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

Below are some examples to consider, in addition to the aforementioned [maturity levels][maturity-levels].

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Initial e2e tests completed and enabled

#### Beta

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Complete features A, B, C
- Additional tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP

#### GA

- N examples of real-world usage
- N installs
- More rigorous forms of testing—e.g., downgrade tests and scalability tests
- Allowing time for feedback

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least two releases between beta and
GA/stable, because there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports,
in back-to-back releases.

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include
[conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md

#### Deprecation

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality that deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag
-->

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Initial benchmarks to compare performance of JSONPath with CEL columns and set an appropriate CEL cost
- Unit tests and integration tests completed and enabled

#### Beta

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Add e2e tests
- Add appropriate metrics for additionalPrinterColumns usage and CEL cost usage
- More benchmarking to compare JSONPath and CEL execution and modify CEL cost if needed

#### GA

- N examples of real-world usage
- Upgrade/downgrade e2e tests
- Scalability tests
- Allowing time for feedback

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to maintain previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to make use of the enhancement?
-->

<!-- No change in how users upgrade/downgrade their clusters. This feature may remove -->
<!-- complexity by removing risk that a tightened validation on Kubernetes' part -->
<!-- does not break workflow. -->

No changes are required for a cluster to make an upgrade and maintain existing behavior.

If the cluster is downgraded to a version which doesn't support CEL for additionalPrinterColumns:
- Existing additionalPrinterColumns with CEL expressions would be ignored and those columns will not be printed. Any create or update operation to CRDs would fail if we try to use CEL for additionalPrinterColumns. 
- Existing additionalPrinterColumns with JSONPath would still work as expected.

Once the cluster is upgraded back to a version supporting CEL for additionalPrinterColumns, users should be able to create CRDs with additionalPrinterColumns using CEL again.

### Version Skew Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other
components? What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
enhancement:
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the control plane and nodes?
- How does an n-3 kubelet or kube-proxy without this feature available behave when this feature is used?
- How does an n-1 kube-controller-manager or kube-scheduler without this feature available behave when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the node change? For example, changes to CSI,
  CRI or CNI may require updating that component before the kubelet.
-->

This feature is implemented in the kube-apiserver component, skew with other kubernetes components do not require coordinated behavior.

Clients should ensure the kube-apiserver is fully rolled out before using the feature.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

<!--

Production readiness reviews are intended to ensure that features merging into
Kubernetes are observable, scalable and supportable; can be safely operated in
production environments, and can be disabled or rolled back in the event they
cause increased failures in production. See more in the PRR KEP at
https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-architecture/1194-prod-readiness.

The production readiness review questionnaire must be completed and approved
for the KEP to move to `implementable` status and be included in the release.

In some cases, the questions below should also have answers in `kep.yaml`. This
is to enable automation to verify the presence of the review, and to reduce review
burden and latency.

The KEP must have a approver from the
[`prod-readiness-approvers`](http://git.k8s.io/enhancements/OWNERS_ALIASES)
team. Please reach out on the
[#prod-readiness](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CPNHUMN74) channel if
you need any help or guidance.
-->

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting alpha to a release.
-->

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

<!--
Pick one of these and delete the rest.

Documentation is available on [feature gate lifecycle] and expectations, as
well as the [existing list] of feature gates.

[feature gate lifecycle]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/feature-gates.md
[existing list]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/
-->

- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: `CRDAdditionalPrinterColumnCEL`
  - Components depending on the feature gate: `apiextensions-apiserver`, `kube-apiserver`
- [ ] Other
  - Describe the mechanism:
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control
    plane?
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning
    of a node?

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

<!--
Any change of default behavior may be surprising to users or break existing
automations, so be extremely careful here.
-->

No default behaviour will be changed since we still support additionalPrinterColumns with JSONPath.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

<!--
Describe the consequences on existing workloads (e.g., if this is a runtime
feature, can it break the existing applications?).

Feature gates are typically disabled by setting the flag to `false` and
restarting the component. No other changes should be necessary to disable the
feature.

NOTE: Also set `disable-supported` to `true` or `false` in `kep.yaml`.
-->

Yes, if the feature is disabled after being used, the existing additionalPrinterColumns with JSONPath would work as expected. Existing resources with CEL expressions in their additionalPrinterColumn definition would be ignored and those columns will not be printed if the feature is disabled.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

CRDs which had failed validation previously might now succeed if the CEL expression is valid. Existing CRDs additionalPrinterColumns defined with CEL expression would start working again after the feature has been reenabled.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

<!--
The e2e framework does not currently support enabling or disabling feature
gates. However, unit tests in each component dealing with managing data, created
with and without the feature, are necessary. At the very least, think about
conversion tests if API types are being modified.

Additionally, for features that are introducing a new API field, unit tests that
are exercising the `switch` of feature gate itself (what happens if I disable a
feature gate after having objects written with the new field) are also critical.
You can take a look at one potential example of such test in:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97058/files#diff-7826f7adbc1996a05ab52e3f5f02429e94b68ce6bce0dc534d1be636154fded3R246-R282
-->

We will have unit and integration tests to make sure that the feature enablement and disablement works as intended.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

<!--
Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
mid-rollout?

Be sure to consider highly-available clusters, where, for example,
feature flags will be enabled on some API servers and not others during the
rollout. Similarly, consider large clusters and how enablement/disablement
will rollout across nodes.
-->

This feature will not impact rollouts or already-running workloads.

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

<!--
What signals should users be paying attention to when the feature is young
that might indicate a serious problem?
-->

If enabling this feature introduces an increase in the latency of the `kubectl get <resources>` (or similar) request durations, in turn creating load on the apiserver, the same can be indicated by apiserver metrics like `apiserver_request_duration_seconds`. If there are significant spikes in these metrics during these GET operations you can try disabling the feature/rolling back the cluster version to see if the performance improves.

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

<!--
Describe manual testing that was done and the outcomes.
Longer term, we may want to require automated upgrade/rollback tests, but we
are missing a bunch of machinery and tooling and can't do that now.
-->

We're planning to test upgrade-> downgrade -> upgrades before graduating to beta.

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

<!--
Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.
-->

No.

### Monitoring Requirements

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

<!--
Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
logs or events for this purpose.
-->

The cluster admin can check if the CRDAdditionalPrinterColumnCEL feature gate is turned on. If yes, the admin can further check if any CRD has any columns defined under `additionalPrinterColumns` section which are using the new `expression` field.

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

<!--
For instance, if this is a pod-related feature, it should be possible to determine if the feature is functioning properly
for each individual pod.
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
Please describe all items visible to end users below with sufficient detail so that they can verify correct enablement
and operation of this feature.
Recall that end users cannot usually observe component logs or access metrics.
-->

- [ ] Events
  - Event Reason: 
- [ ] API .status
  - Condition name: 
  - Other field: 
- [x] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details: Users will be able to define additionalPrinterColumns for their custom resources with `expression` instead of `jsonPath`.

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

<!--
This is your opportunity to define what "normal" quality of service looks like
for a feature.

It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99.9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code

These goals will help you determine what you need to measure (SLIs) in the next
question.
-->

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

<!--
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
-->

- [ ] Metrics
  - Metric name:
  - [Optional] Aggregation method:
  - Components exposing the metric:
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

<!--
Describe the metrics themselves and the reasons why they weren't added (e.g., cost,
implementation difficulties, etc.).
-->

No.

### Dependencies

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

<!--
Think about both cluster-level services (e.g. metrics-server) as well
as node-level agents (e.g. specific version of CRI). Focus on external or
optional services that are needed. For example, if this feature depends on
a cloud provider API, or upon an external software-defined storage or network
control plane.

For each of these, fill in the following—thinking about running existing user workloads
and creating new ones, as well as about cluster-level services (e.g. DNS):
  - [Dependency name]
    - Usage description:
      - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:
-->

No.

### Scalability

<!--
For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them.

For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API call type (e.g. PATCH pods)
  - estimated throughput
  - originating component(s) (e.g. Kubelet, Feature-X-controller)
Focusing mostly on:
  - components listing and/or watching resources they didn't before
  - API calls that may be triggered by changes of some Kubernetes resources
    (e.g. update of object X triggers new updates of object Y)
  - periodic API calls to reconcile state (e.g. periodic fetching state,
    heartbeats, leader election, etc.)
-->

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type
  - Supported number of objects per cluster
  - Supported number of objects per namespace (for namespace-scoped objects)
-->

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - Which API(s):
  - Estimated increase:
-->

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type(s):
  - Estimated increase in size: (e.g., new annotation of size 32B)
  - Estimated amount of new objects: (e.g., new Object X for every existing Pod)
-->

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

<!--
Look at the [existing SLIs/SLOs].

Think about adding additional work or introducing new steps in between
(e.g. need to do X to start a container), etc. Please describe the details.

[existing SLIs/SLOs]: https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#kubernetes-slisslos
-->

Performance of CRD reads might be impacted. Benchmarking needs to be done to know the exact difference between using JSONPath and CEL.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

<!--
Things to keep in mind include: additional in-memory state, additional
non-trivial computations, excessive access to disks (including increased log
volume), significant amount of data sent and/or received over network, etc.
This through this both in small and large cases, again with respect to the
[supported limits].

[supported limits]: https://git.k8s.io/community//sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md
-->

Since the CEL expressions are compiled and evaluated in the kube-apiserver, depending on the complexity of the CRDs and the expressions defined, we may see a non-negligible increase of CPU usage. We are planning to benchmark this before beta graduation.

###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

<!--
Focus not just on happy cases, but primarily on more pathological cases
(e.g. probes taking a minute instead of milliseconds, failed pods consuming resources, etc.).
If any of the resources can be exhausted, how this is mitigated with the existing limits
(e.g. pods per node) or new limits added by this KEP?

Are there any tests that were run/should be run to understand performance characteristics better
and validate the declared limits?
-->

No.

### Troubleshooting

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.
-->

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

The same way any write to apiserver would.

###### What are other known failure modes?

<!--
For each of them, fill in the following information by copying the below template:
  - [Failure mode brief description]
    - Detection: How can it be detected via metrics? Stated another way:
      how can an operator troubleshoot without logging into a master or worker node?
    - Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    - Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
      Not required until feature graduated to beta.
    - Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why.
-->

None.

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

Disable the feature.

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

An alternative to the CEL approach proposed by this KEP would be to extend JSONPath to support arrays and other complex queries. There have been a couple of attempts to implement this previously.

- [Adding support for complex json paths in AdditionalPrinterColumns #101205](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101205)
- [apiextensions: allow complex json paths for additionalPrinterColumns #67079](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67079)

These attempts were not successful because of breaking changes to JSONPath. Now that we have CEL as an option, we can move away from trying to extend JSONPath and embrace CEL, since it covers a much larger ground than what we could achieve with extending JSONPath.

## Infrastructure Needed (Optional)

<!--
Use this section if you need things from the project/SIG. Examples include a
new subproject, repos requested, or GitHub details. Listing these here allows a
SIG to get the process for these resources started right away.
